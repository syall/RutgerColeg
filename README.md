## Story  
What does it mean to be a Scarlet Knight?  

As students at Rutgers University, we have seen a lot. Actually, maybe not a lot, but enough.  

We all come from different backgrounds and have different goals, but we are all connected to ol' Rutger.  

**Both good and the bad.**

There is a lot that goes on when you first get here, and this game is meant to give one a small taste, a bit of relatability.  

Starting from when we left high school (perhaps with higher aspirations), we still ended up here (thankfully).

But we now have grown to accept Rutger for who it is.  

The [culture](https://github.com/syall/RutgerColeg/blob/master/art/background/dutta.jpg), [songs](https://github.com/syall/RutgerColeg/tree/master/sound/music), and classic [RU Screw](https://github.com/syall/RutgerColeg/blob/master/art/background/tution.png) come in many forms, and this game has a blatant unelegant display of exactly that.

I hope that this game will remind us of our roots and encourage us based on where we are now.

Bless Rutger.

Honestly, it was great to work on something we love and relate to at HackRU F18.  
We are a team of students from a freshman to two juniors, little to lots of experience, and a whole lot of inspiration from our soon-to-be alma mater.

Thank you for taking a look at our repository.  
Maybe it will be updated in the future, maybe not.  
We start on the banks of the Raritan, and don't know where it leads.

Thanks again,
